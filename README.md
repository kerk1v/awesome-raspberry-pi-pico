## IDE for Raspberry Pi Pico (W)

Probably the most widely used IDE / Editor for the Raspberry Pi Pico with Micropython is [[Thonny]](https://thonny.org/)]. It does not only allow you to develop for, send programs to and debug the Raspberry Pi Pico but also to install the MicroPython and CircuitPython firmwares on your Pico.
